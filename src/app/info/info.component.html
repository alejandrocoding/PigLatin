            <p class="info">Pig Latin is a language game or argot in which words in English are altered, usually by adding a fabricated suffix
                or by moving the onset or initial consonant or consonant cluster of a word to the end of the word and adding
                a vocalic syllable to create such a suffix.</p>
            <p class="info">The objective is to conceal the words from others not familiar with the rules.</p>
            <p class="info">The reference to Latin is a deliberate misnomer; Pig Latin is simply a form of argot or jargon unrelated to Latin,
                and the name is used for its English connotations as a strange and foreign-sounding language.</p>
